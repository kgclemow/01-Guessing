# 01-Guessing
This is a simple number guessing game created as a project for my C220 Game Technology class at IU. The game is written in Python, and the project aims to teach me about basic data types and control structures as well as the workings of Github. 

In this game, the player is told to guess a number between 1 and 100. If the player does not insert a number, they will be prompted to try again and do so. The player will have as many tries as they need to guess the correct random number and will be given a clue of "too high" or "too low" after each guess. When the correct number is guessed, the player will be congradulated, told the number of tries he/she took, and asked if the player would like to start again.
